				cupping is an alternative medicinal therapy that dates back to several ancient cultures. Michael Phelps and other US athletes brought the modality to the world when used during the 2016 Olympics for recovery. How does it work? A therapist creates suction with the cups and places them on different areas of the skin, for several minutes, which creates a vacuum and pulls blood to the surface. It has been used to help with blood circulation, pain, inflammation, and relaxation. Although considered a pseudoscience by modern medicine, cupping has been an accepted form of therapy by many to help with scar tissue, connective tissue issues, and pain associated with tightness and inflammation in the muscles.

				<h5><b>What should you expect during your cupping therapy session with One Body Massage?</b></h5>
				<br>
				<p>We’ll do an initial assessment to determine the areas needing treatment. I’ll do a light massage over the area then place the cups on for several minutes (time depends on location and severity of pain). Once the cups are removed, you’ll receive a deeper massage and vibrational therapy over the area, concluding with an anti-inflammatory topical cream. Most will experience marks that can last anywhere from one to ten days depending on the severity of the muscle pain.</p>
