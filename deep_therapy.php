				Photobio-what? Photobiomodulation therapy is a form of nonthermal light therapy that has been used to alleviate pain, inflammation, immunomodulation, and the promotion of wound healing and tissue regeneration
			
			<p>
				<h5>
					<b>How does photobiomodulation work?</b>
				</h5>
				<br>
				<p>In non-science terms, laser therapy will allow your cells tp produce more energy, blood vessels widen, healthy cell growth occurs, and inflammatory response decreases. Microcirculation is improved to the damaged tissue, delivering oxygen, vital sugars, proteins, and salts while removing waste. Anyone experiencing inflammation can benefit from laser therapy. It is not recommended for pregnant women or on growth plates of young children.</p>

			</p>


			<p>
				<h5>
					<b>What should you expect during your deep tissue laser therapy session?</b>
				</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The treatment must be applied to bare skin in order for the light to be absorbed into the tissue. You will feel a slight comfortable warm sensation while the therapy is applied. Special glasses must be worn to protect the eyes from the reflective light. Treatment times vary depending upon the area and condition. There are specific protocols for both acute and chronic pain ranging from 1 to 12 sessions. Most conditions will see results within 3 sessions. Chronic conditions such as arthritis may take longer and will require the occasional maintenance sessions.</p>
