				Kinesiology tape is used to help with muscle pain, inflammation, bruising, and fatigue. When placed on the skin, it slightly lifts it and reduces sensations on the pain receptors that signal the brain. Think back to when you were a child and how a kiss or band-aid would instantly take away the pain. RockTape has a similar effect of telling our brain the pain has lessened. By lifting the skin, circulation increases which allows more oxygen and the drainage of byproducts to affected areas, speeding up healing and recovery time. Taping can also be done to compress a muscle or muscle group providing stability to athletes during performance or post-injury. If you want extra support before a competition, game, race, or other sports event, taping is for you. RockTape will allow you to continue to compete and train while nursing minor muscular injuries.

					<b>What should you expect during your RockTape session?</b>
				</h5>
				<br>
				<p>An initial assessment will be done to determine the area and type of taping style. The tape is cut to size and placed over the area. Taping can be done solo or as an add-on after a treatment. The tape can be left on for several days and kept on during a shower/bath. RockSauce topical anti-pain cream can be applied directly on the tape for added relief. One Body Massages carries RockTape products for purchase and is happy to show you the basics of how to apply it.</p>

				<h5>
					<b>What should you expect during your deep tissue laser therapy session?</b>
				</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The treatment must be applied to bare skin in order for the light to be absorbed into the tissue. You will feel a slight comfortable warm sensation while the therapy is applied. Special glasses must be worn to protect the eyes from the reflective light. Treatment times vary depending upon the area and condition. There are specific protocols for both acute and chronic pain ranging from 1 to 12 sessions. Most conditions will see results within 3 sessions. Chronic conditions such as arthritis may take longer and will require the occasional maintenance sessions.</p>
